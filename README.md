# Online Auction System (name later)

## Overview
In today's age, people can buy, sell, pay for everything online. Why not be
able to auction items online. With *app name here*, people will be able to post
items they wish to auction off. When a user posts an item, they will have the option for
how long they wish to put the item up, the starting bid, and the minimum increment.
Other users may place bids and look up items currently up for auction. 

## Features
- Users can **post** items to the online auction
- Users can **place** bids and **buy** items
- User **authentication** (maybe)
- Users can **search** up items they are looking for
- Users can see the current **status** of the auction
    - Current bid
    - Minimum increments
    - Time left and more

## Usage
This app will be used by everyday people looking to auction off items who don't
have the time to go to an auction house. 

## Interest
My grandfather was an auctioneer and going to his events were really entertaining,
and I am a huge fan of Storage Wars. In our now digital age, I felt like making
an application which makes auctions easy and accessible to everyone online.
